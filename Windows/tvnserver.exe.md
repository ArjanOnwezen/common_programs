### The magic behind ```tvnserver.exe```
Tvnserver.exe is an executable file that belongs to the **TightVNC** program, an free, open source application designed to provide users with the ability to remotely view and control a target computer with a local mouse and keyboard. 
TightVNC is a remote viewing program that lets users monitor and control other computers through a main computer on which the software is installed. To get the best results out of the system, however, it is advised to install TightVNC on the target computer as well. 
The program supports multiple platforms and uses tightly encoded combinations of JPEG and zlib compression algorithms to deliver video data from the controlled computer to the controller. 
TightVNC was created by Constantin Kaplinsky, a Russian programmer, in 2000. It is currently maintained by GlavSoft, a company based in Tomsk, Russia.
